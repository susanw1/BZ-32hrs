# BZ-32hrs

I wrote this code as a challenge in 1996, to see if I could write a reasonable Battlezone clone in under a (24hr) day. In the end, it took an extra few hours to make it work nicely, so it became the "Battlezone in 32 hours" version!

For a long time, I kept the code under wraps because it's not that pretty, and I felt bad that people might judge me professionally by it: this was the first non-toy Java program I'd ever written, and I can't fix it up without feeling that I'm cheating. 

To run:

1.  Clone the repo
1.  Install Java and Maven
1.  Execute: 
```
     cd BattleZone32hrs
     mvn exec:java
```

I did a bit of a rewrite a few years later; I'll try to get that working and push it one of these days. I might even translate it into Javascript and then we can all play it!
